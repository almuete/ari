Interrupt commands (AI stops talking, session stays open)
"stop it": Interrupts the current AI response/audio, but keeps the session open so you can continue.
"stop talking": Same—cuts off the AI mid-response without ending the session.
"stop speaking": Same—immediately interrupts the AI response/audio, session remains open.
Stop/end commands (ends the session)

Each of these triggers a full session stop/cleanup (disconnects/ends the live session):
"bye": Ends the session.
"bye bye": Ends the session.
"goodbye": Ends the session.
"good bye": Ends the session.
"see you later": Ends the session.
"see you soon": Ends the session.
"see you tomorrow": Ends the session.
"see you next time": Ends the session.
"see you next week": Ends the session.
"see you next month": Ends the session.
"see you next year": Ends the session.
"see you next decade": Ends the session.
"see you next century": Ends the session.
"see you next millennium": Ends the session.

Notes (important behavior)
Case-insensitive + word-boundary matching: “Bye!”, “GOODBYE”, etc. should match.
Also triggers if the AI says it: if the AI’s transcript contains “bye/goodbye/…”, your app will also stop the session.
